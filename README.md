Python features like **variable annotation**, **async functions**, and **async comprehension** improve code readability and concurrency, while **unittest** and **integration tests** ensure code correctness and system interaction.

| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| 0x00  | [Python Variable Annotations](./0x00-python_variable_annotations/)                                                                                      |**Python variable annotation** allows developers to specify the type of a variable using a colon (`:`) syntax, improving code readability and enabling type-checking tools like **mypy**. It doesn't affect the program's execution but provides hints for better development practices. Example: `x: int = 5`.|            
| 0x01  | [Python Async Function](./0x01-python_async_function/)                                                                                                  |**Python async functions** use the `async def` syntax to define functions that run asynchronously, allowing non-blocking operations. They enable concurrent execution of tasks, typically used with `await` to pause and resume execution, improving performance in I/O-bound applications.|
| 0x02  | [Python Async Comprehension](./0x02-python_async_comprehension/)                                                                                        |**Python async comprehension** allows asynchronous iteration over asynchronous generators or objects, using `async for` and `async with` to handle data in an asynchronous context. It helps in processing large datasets or I/O-bound tasks concurrently, improving performance without blocking the execution flow. |                                                                                                                                                                 
| 0x03  | [Python Unittests and Intergration Tests](./0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests/)                                                                      |**Python unittest** is a testing framework that allows developers to create unit tests for individual components of code, ensuring correctness. **Integration tests** validate the interaction between different modules or systems, ensuring they work together as expected. Both are essential for maintaining code quality and reliability.          |
